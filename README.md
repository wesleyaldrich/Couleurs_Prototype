# Couleurs
  **Couleurs** is a simple image colorizing project. The program is supposed to receive inputs in form of images, then return the colorized same image.
  This project utilizes the model of **DeOldify by Jason Antic** as the AI to colorize images.

# How to use
  Clone this repository into your device, then run the "app.py" file from your terminal (e.g. "python app.py" for Windows, "python3 app.py" for Ubuntu).
  If any error pops up, it might be because some required libraries are not in your device. Install all the dependencies that are "_unrecognized_".
